      "The bike's front suspension doesn't take hard humps easily. Even commuter bikes do run well on humps. But xpulse makes weird noise (front suspension) whenever It runs through humps.I think hero material quality is very low compared to any brands which are in market.The only thing is it's price is quite okay as a 200cc bike.. pickup is good."

The product does not have features that the user wants to avoid. The review count (5) is below the user's minimum threshold of 10. While the sentiment score (0.75) exceeds the threshold of 0.2, and the confidence score (70.0) is at the threshold, the low review count impacts the overall preference match.",
