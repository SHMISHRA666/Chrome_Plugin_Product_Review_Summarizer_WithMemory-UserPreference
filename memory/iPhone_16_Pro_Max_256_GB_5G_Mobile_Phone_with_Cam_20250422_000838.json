      "I love the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It's big, powerful, and up for anything. Yes, I play a console-level game on it without any issue. It takes lovely photos that, even if you choose not to try out the new styles and undertones, are clear and color-accurate.Key SpecsApple iPhone 16 Pro MaxRAM 8 GBProcessor Apple A18 ProRear Camera 48 MP + 48 MP + 12 MPFront Camera 12 MPBattery 4685 mAhDisplay 6.9 inches (17.53 cm)Pros:*Larger screens/thinner bezels*4K slo-mo, OMG*Powerful processor*Camera control for instant camera access*Good performance & battery life*Excellent cameras & useful Photo Styles*Video capabilities & Audio Mix*Apple IntelligenceCons:*No 8K video recording*Slow charging*Pricey",
      "iOS has lost the polish and stability it used to carry beforeoverall still a great phone",
      "Defective product sold by the seller. Network, activation and restart issue within 7 days. Apple and amazon neither took responsibility and diverted me towards service centre where they took my phone in for 10 working days. Never buy apple products from Amazon.",
      "Excellent phone, Apple Intelligence is amazing, the battery life is mind blowing and comes with the best camera. If you have a 13 Pro Max or older, go for it. If you have a 14 Pro Max, the only difference you are going to see is Apple Intelligence, better battery life and slightly better cameras. Otherwise it's going to feel like the exact same phone if you use it without a case as the rounded eges in 16 Pro Max are better to use without cases. Skip and save money if you have the 15 Pro Max because the difference is negligible. The black titanium color looks gorgeous and the only good color in the current series. It's a shame they removed the Blue Titanium color. Also costs 15-20k less than the launch price of 15 Pro Max so that is a huge plus.",
      "I did not like it at first. Its my first iPhone. I have used Samsung, Oneplus and Xiaomi phones. 16 Pro Max has many flaws. Android is much better now. But iOS is very smooth.Things I liked:1. Speakers are amazing.2. Battery life is good.3. Overall smoothness.4. Camera is great.Things I did not like:1. All the Web Browsers (Safari or others) are limited to 60hz.2. No option for menu bar navigation (android has both gestures and bar).3. Display / Screen color is fixed at Natural tone (no option for Vivid etc).4. Restricted files/folder access and many other UI limitations.5. Managing Whatsapp media is a mess (its much simpler on android).6. Telephoto 5X images are too soft.7. No separate Camera folder in Photos app for the photos you take with your phone.",
